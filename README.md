# Project description

### Function:
Using this SalesManager, you can find out the max value among a massive of numbers.

### How it works:
1. SalesManager takes a massive of integer values as argument in its constructor
2. in method max, integer max is created, with initial value -1
3. numbers from massive are taken one by one and updated into "max" whenever it's value is greater than that of "max"


### How to use:

- create an object from SalesManager, filling a massive of integer numbers as parameter
- use this object to use method max
- use ```System.out.println(manager.max())``` for demonstration, if needed
